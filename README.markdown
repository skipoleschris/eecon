# EECon Presentation

A sample project for the Equal Experts Conference. Demonstrates transforming a highly imperative and procedural Java program to a much more strongly typed functional version in Scala.

The imperative solution has the main code in Java with a Scala unit test.

The functional solution has all code in Scala. It utilises immutability, referential transparency and a for-comprehension. It also encodes many of the rules about what can be done with the code into the type system.
